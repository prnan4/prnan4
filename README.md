## Hi there, I'm Nandhinee Periyakaruppan 👋

### 👩‍💻 &nbsp;About Me
🎓 Currently I am pursuing an MS in Computer Science at [UMass Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu), with a keen interest in machine learning and software development. My research spans text-to-image generative models and Few-shot ICD Coding at Meta and the BioNLP Lab, UMass Amherst.\
💡 As a Data Science Intern at [Zuora](https://www.zuora.com), I optimized operations for payment retries by migrating Spark DataFrames to Pandas and deploying solutions on AWS Lambda. I also contributed significantly to an NLP-driven IT Assistant SlackBot, reducing IT issue resolution time by 75%.\
🚀 Previously, as a Research Engineer at [BUDDI AI](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=buddi+ai&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), I led a team in automating Document Content Extraction from EHRs. I proposed a Multi-task Object Detection network, achieving a 10% performance boost over competitors, and created scalable services handling 1.3 million hits per day.\
📑 I hold a patent for ["DEXTER"](https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20220284722), an end-to-end system for extracting table contents from electronic medical health documents. My publications focus on machine learning approaches for offense target identification in social media and severity scoring of lung tuberculosis in CT images.\
🔍 I am actively seeking full-time roles in MLE and SDE, I bring academic rigor and practical experience to cutting-edge projects.
